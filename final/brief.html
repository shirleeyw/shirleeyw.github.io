            <h2>Project Summary</h2>
            <p>
                For my final project, I plan on further developing my Mad Libs 2.0 project by changing the layout, expanding on the content, and adding interactive elements.

            <h2>Comparison Project 1</h2>
            <h3> <a href = "https://10ideesrecuesenuxdesign.castoretpollux.com/en/">10 Misconceptions on UX to Get Around</a></h3>
            <p>
                I thought this website made going through the quiz such a fun experience, with all the bright colors and interesting motion graphics. I enjoyed all the interactive elements that this website had like the ‘clicking-and-dragging’ of the statement into the trash can. The website presented the answer choices in very creative ways for each question that made it visually appealing and kept me interested in the information that was presented. I like how there was a progress bar at the top that helped me keep track of how much I had completed and how many questions I still had left. At first, I found the floating “fun fact” to be a bit distracting, but I realized that once it was clicked on, an icon was added at the bottom that only appeared on hover.

            <h2>Comparison Project 2</h2>
            <h3> <a href = "https://yourplanyourplanet.sustainability.google/">Your Plan, Your Planet</a></h3>
            <p>
                I thought this website had a very clean design that made it easy to understand and navigate. The color choices were consistent throughout and were very pleasing to the eye. There were motion graphics paired with everything that made it visually interesting. The type hierarchy made it clear as to what was more important and made it easy for me to follow. There were a lot of microinteractions, which all enhanced the overall experience, like the scaling of the answer choices when hovered over and how the different sustainability tips popped up on the screen first in a small circle and then enlarged to show the information. Something that could be improved on is the placement of the progress bar because I had to scroll to see it, so it was a hassle to have to scroll down to see how much I had left to complete.

            <h2>Project Goals</h2>
            <p>
                My goals for this project is to add interesting motion graphics and interaction design elements. Because my initial project was just a static design, I think adding motion graphics will make it a more fun and engaging experience for users as they go through the Mad Lib form. After studying the two Comparison Projects, I think it would be cool for each question to have its own page. Although this is different from the typical Mad Lib form we are used to seeing, I think it will help to create a more dynamic experience.

            <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
            <p>
                As for design strategies, I plan on keeping the font I am currently using, but want to expand the color palette, since I am mainly only using reds and pinks. I will be redesigning the form, so that each input has its own page. Each individual page will have different Valentine’s Day themed motion graphics. I hope to format the pages so that there will be no need for a scroll bar, since I feel like that can be annoying for users.

            <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
            <p>
                I plan on adding more microinteractions, so that when users hover over certain buttons, the button will enlarge or change color. I also want to add some aural feedback as well to make the form more playful, like having a kiss sound effect when the submit button is pressed. Since I liked the idea of the progress bar from the two Comparison Projects, I want to implement something like that to my form, so users can easily tell how much they have completed and how much is left. I also want to include a ‘restart’ button as well, so that users can clear the form if they want to change their answers.

            <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
            <p>
                My goal is to ultimately create a fun and playful experience for my audience because Mad Libs are supposed to generate a silly story, but why not make the experience of filling it out fun as well? I shared my initial Mad Libs project with friends and they had a lot of fun with it, so I hope that this redesigned experience will have the same positive response. From studying the two Comparison Projects, I will take inspiration from them and add microinteractions, motion graphics, and work on the interaction design to create a more engaging experience.
